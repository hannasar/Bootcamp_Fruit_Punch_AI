# Bootcamp_Fruit_Punch_AI
Bootcamp took place in the beginning of 2021

In the repository, you can see a presentation of the final project "Credit Card Fraud Detection". In the team of three (Demi, Kam, Hania), we explored the data, created prediction models, and choose one of them as the best one. The presentation was conducted as storytelling with the main character named Mark.
